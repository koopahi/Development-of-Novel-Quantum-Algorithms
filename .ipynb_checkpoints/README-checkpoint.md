The study reports experimental results from a noisy 127-qubit quantum processor, In this project, we demonstrate that we can run the suzuki trotter algorithm for 3 qubits in multiple iterations and we can construct the algorithmic structure for noise cancellation. Also that accurate expectation values can be measured at a scale beyond what classical computation can achieve.Â 

Quantum Hamiltonian simulation is a critical challenge in quantum computing. It involves modeling the time evolution of a quantum system governed by a Hamiltonian that cannot be directly executed on a given device. Such simulations are vital for understanding quantum systems with complex dynamics, like molecules in chemistry or materials in condensed matter physics, where classical computers struggle due to the exponential increase in computational complexity as the size of the quantum system grows. In this project, you will be using Classiq to work with simple problems of Hamiltonian simulation in the context of error cancellation with Suzuki Trotter algorithm.
